transcription-guidelines: >-
  The original transcriptions were performed on a crowdsourcing application
  (https://testaments-de-poilus.huma-num.fr/#!/) under the supervision of the
  Archives nationales de France. Only the allographic portions of the documents
  were transcribed. Any marginal elements added later by clerks or archivists
  are neither segmented nor transcribed. The segmentation follows the SegmOnto
  ontology. Abbreviations and mispelling were not corrected. Superscripted
  portions of text are preceeded by ^.
