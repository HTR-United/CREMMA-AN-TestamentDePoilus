transcription-guidelines: 'The original transcriptions were performed on a crowdsourcing
  application (https://testaments-de-poilus.huma-num.fr/#!/) under the supervision
  of the Archives nationales de France. Only the allographic portions of the documents
  were transcribed. Any marginal elements added later by clerks or archivists are
  neither segmented nor transcribed. The segmentation follows the SegmOnto ontology.
  Abbreviations and mispelling were not corrected. Superscripted portions of text
  are preceeded by ^. '
